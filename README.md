## API Description
This API is built with FastAPI and served using Uvicorn. The service listens for Pub/Sub events to trigger its execution. Its primary task is to predict emotions from user journals and generate feedback based on them. We use a model developed by our ML team to predict the emotions, and a fine-tuned model with Vertex AI to generate the feedback. The results are then published to a Pub/Sub event.
